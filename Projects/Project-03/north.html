					Dragons have assumed many animal forms over the
					millennia, residing in mountains and streams. They have
					been deified and occasionally demonized, though they are
					widely revered as providers of protection and symbols of
					plenty in China. Those that lived in one of three mystical
					ranges of the Southern Mountains roamed an area
					containing fourteen mountains that stretched 6,500 li, from
					Lushan all the way to Nanli shan. Unlike denizens of the
					other two ranges, which had dragon heads atop bird bodies
					or bird heads on dragon bodies, these mountain gods had
					footed serpentine bodies and faces of a somewhat hideous
					nature. Worship of the human-faced dragons required
					the sacrifice of a white dog and an offering of the finest
					polished rice.

			Long ago, in the remote past, a peak called Beiyue shan existed in what is now the Dorbod Banner region of Inner
			Mongolia. It was where the Zhuhuai River began its flow westward to the Qi River, waters that were hospitable to a
			strange fish called the Yi, with a fish body and the head of a dog. The Yi was eagerly sought by fishermen, who
			followed its whimpering cry. Its flesh was used to treat infantile convulsions and mental illness.

			Bianchun shan, a mountain three hundred ninety li north of Danxun shan, was lushly covered with native vegetation
			and fruit, including wild onions and mountain peaches. It was also home to an entertaining, almost comical animal
			called the Youyan, Adept at bounding from branch to branch high in the forest canopy, it had the skills and
			appearance of a monkey, though its fur was striped top and bottom and end to end. It called its own name from
			morning to night, and seemed alway to be smiling or laughing. It loved to play tricks on humans, feigning death or
			sleep, but its audience was never fooled into letting it draw near.
