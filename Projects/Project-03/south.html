					Dragons have assumed many animal forms over the
					millennia, residing in mountains and streams. They have
					been deified and occasionally demonized, though they are
					widely revered as providers of protection and symbols of
					plenty in China. Those that lived in one of three mystical
					ranges of the Southern Mountains roamed an area
					containing fourteen mountains that stretched 6,500 li, from
					Lushan all the way to Nanli shan. Unlike denizens of the
					other two ranges, which had dragon heads atop bird bodies
					or bird heads on dragon bodies, these mountain gods had
					footed serpentine bodies and faces of a somewhat hideous
					nature. Worship of the human-faced dragons required
					the sacrifice of a white dog and an offering of the finest
					polished rice.

			The Fenghuang, known as the phoenix, was the king of the 360 species of birds. It had the look of a golden pheasant,
			with feathers that dazzled the eye. Of the five elements, its green head represented wood, its white neck metal, its
			red back fire, its black chest water, and its yellow feet earth. Its feathers were patterned to represent written
			characters: on its head a fini for "virtue”; on each of its wings a X, for
			“righteousness”; on its back a Til for “courtesy"; on its chest a E for “benevolence"; and on its belly a À for
			“trust.” When the four virtues of benevolence, righteousness, courtesy, and trust were displayed on its body, and
			with its every auspicious
			appearance, the world was at peace. Historically, there were both male (feng) and female (huang) entities, but the
			female predominated and is now linked to the mythical dragon. No wonder it is considered the most important bird in
			Chinese
			civilization.
