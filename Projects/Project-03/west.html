					Four mountain ranges comprise the total of the Western Mountains. The third range stretched from Chongwu shan all
					the way to Yiwang shan, a total of 6,744 li, with twenty-three mountain peaks. All the immortal animals on these
					mountains, male and female, were goatlike creatures with scowling faces. Worshippers of these legendary beasts
					were required to bury a lucky piece of patterned jade in the ground and make offerings of sinica rice. Ancient
					peoples burned offerings to heavenly deities, sending them skyward in puffs of smoke. If they celebrated earthly
					or mountain deities, they buried their offerings in the ground. The same logic applied to river deities, whose
					offerings were flung into the water.

			Fuyu shan was also the nesting place for a marvelous bird
			known as the Min. Its red beak and clusters of red feathers on
			the tip of its tail were all that distinguished it from the common
			kingfisher. People fortunate enough to have caught one and
			kept it at home were assured of fire protection, a boon for those
			ancients who lived in houses made mainly of wood. Its call,
			either in the wild or in cages, has never been described, though
			unlike the thin whistle of a kingfisher, it was likely something
			louder and more urgent to warn of fire. Killing and eating a
			Min was taboo for obvious reasons.

			Snakes have no feet; they slither. The ancient Feiwei, however,
			had six feet. They were augmented by four small wings
			clustered just behind its ferocious head. How the strange
			apparition moved remains a mystery, but at each miraculous
			advent on Taihua shan, now known as Yuehua shan, severe
			drought fell upon the land below.
